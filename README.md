Project Overview:
The project involves building an application to maintain information for school classes using a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. The application will provide various operations to manage student data, such as insertion, searching, updating, deletion, and listing students in different orders. The program should also support saving student data to a file and loading it back automatically if the file exists.

Functional Requirements:
Insert a Student: Allow the user to input information for a new student and insert it into the BST.

Find and Update Student: Enable searching for a student by their ID, and if found, allow updating their information.

List Students in Lexicographic Order of Names: Display all students in lexicographic order of their names.

Search Students by City: Provide the ability to search for students from a given city and list them in lexicographic order of their names.

List Students by Class: Allow listing all students by their class ID in lexicographic order of their names.

Delete a Student: Enable deleting a student given their student ID.

Save and Load Students from File: Implement functionality to save all student data to a file (students.data) and load it back automatically if the file exists.
